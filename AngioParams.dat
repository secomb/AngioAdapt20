0.22 		smax (k_p), prob of sprout formation = smax*thresh*segment_length*timestep
160			nsprmax, maximum number of new sprouts per time step
333.		Vmax (V_g), maximal rate of growth, um/day
5.			min_length, if length < min_length, no growth
0.7			thresh, threshold concentration for sprout formation (arb units)
0.05		variance, gives the amount of wiggle in direction of new growth 
8.			new_diam (D_s), diameter_of_new_vessels, um
11.			increment, amount seg increments by then checks for intercept. Should be > tolerance_1 to avoid spurious intercepts
10.			tolerance_1, if closest point on another seg within this distance=>intercept at point (10)
10.			tolerance_2, if increments to within this distance of new_point, stops incrementing (10)
